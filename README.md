# Next.js 15 Dynamic Import Issue in Client Component with Server Component

This repository demonstrates a bug in Next.js 15 where dynamic imports within a `useEffect` hook inside a client component fail silently when importing server components.  The dynamic import of a server component function within a client component's useEffect hook fails silently or throws a module not found error.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the error (or lack thereof) in the browser's console.

## Solution
The solution involves refactoring to either avoid dynamic imports within the useEffect or to ensure the data fetching is handled more robustly before trying to access the imported server component.  This may involve using suspense or a different data fetching mechanism to prevent race conditions.
